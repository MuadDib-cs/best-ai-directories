# Best AI Websites and Directories

I started putting together this list because I got tired of hunting through Twitter threads and Reddit posts every time I needed something. Whether you're coding, making videos, or just curious about what's actually useful (not just hyped), this is basically my attempt to save you the headaches I've had. I've grouped everything by what they actually do, and included those directory sites that help when you need something specific. Not everything here is perfect, but these are the tools that people - including me - actually end up using rather than just trying once and forgetting about.

## **Best AI Directories**
The websites I end up visiting way too often when hunting for AI tools:

- **[There's An AI For That (TAAFT)](https://theresanaiforthat.com/)**
